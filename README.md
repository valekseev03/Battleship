# Battleship
Battleship game using the Java console

To play compile this in a java compiler (preferably eclipse) and run. You can play with an "AI" or another player. Use the console to play. Sorry for any spaghetti code this was made in my sophomore year of high school, so feel free to modify it. Also feel free to view any other projects I made.
